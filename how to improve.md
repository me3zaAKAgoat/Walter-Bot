Here are some suggestions to improve this projects codebase:

- Use a logging library such as Winston instead of console.log() for better log management and easier log analysis.
- Add error handling to the catch block to ensure that exceptions are properly logged and handled.
- Extract the role creation logic into a separate function for better readability and easier maintenance.
- Consider using a constant for the hardcoded role names instead of embedding them in multiple places throughout the code.
- Consider using a constant for the hardcoded colors instead of embedding them in multiple places throughout the code.
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation for better readability and easier maintenance.
- Consider using an environment variable for the welcome channel ID instead of hardcoding it.
- Add comments to explain the logic and the purpose of the code.
- Proper naming of variables and functions: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions that make it easier to understand the code at a glance.
- DRY principle: Instead of creating two similar cron jobs for different tasks, you can create a generic cron job that takes a callback function as an argument.
- Add error handling: Currently, the code does not have any error handling in case a database operation fails. It's a good practice to add error handling to make sure the code is robust and provides meaningful error messages to the users in case of any issues.
- Extract the common parts: There's some repeated code in the implementation of different sub-commands. This code can be extracted into a separate function to make the code more readable and maintainable.
- Better validation: The code can be improved to validate user inputs better and make sure they follow the expected format. For example, in the rate sub-command, the code can check if the rating value is within the valid range of 1-10.
- Proper naming conventions: The code follows camelCase naming conventions for variables, but the naming conventions for functions and objects are not clear. It's better to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.

- You can use an object to store the information for each meme type, and use the type value to access the corresponding information in the object. This would make the code much cleaner and more maintainable:

```js
const memes = {
	squidward: {
		padding: 1,
		lineHeight: 4,
	},
	wallace: {
		padding: 20,
		lineHeight: 4,
	},
	vibrator: {
		padding: 1,
		lineHeight: 4,
	},
	sirtat: {
		padding: 20,
		lineHeight: 225,
	},
};

module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
		.setName("meme")
		.setDescription("makes a meme out of your input")
		.addStringOption((option) =>
			option
				.setName("type")
				.setDescription("Select animal for photo")
				.setRequired(true)
				.addChoices(
					{ name: "when Im in a competition", value: "squidward" },
					{ name: "allo o_o", value: "wallace" },
					{ name: "vibrator", value: "vibrator" },
					{ name: "sir tat... w 3ad aji", value: "sirtat" }
				)
		)
		.addStringOption((option) =>
			option
				.setName("text")
				.setDescription("the text that fills the meme")
				.setRequired(true)
		),
	execute: async (interaction) => {
		const type = interaction.options.getString("type");
		const content = interaction.options.getString("text");
		if (content.length > 100) {
			return interaction.editReply({
				content: "ðŸš« You have way too many characters to fit in this meme.",
				ephemeral: true,
			});
		}

		const memeInfo = memes[type];
		if (!memeInfo) {
			return interaction.editReply({
				content: "This meme template does not exist.",
				ephemeral: true,
			});
		}

		await interaction.deferReply();
		writeMeme(type, content, memeInfo.padding, memeInfo.lineHeight)
			.then(async (meme) => {
				await interaction.editReply({ files: [meme] });
			})
			.catch((error) => console.log(error));
	},
};
```

- Use constants for repetitive values: Instead of writing VOTES_NEEDED + 1 multiple times in your code, you can use a constant for the value.
- Use Discord.js's ReactionCollector instead of manually counting the reactions: This will make the code easier to maintain and reduce the chance of bugs.
- Use an attachment instead of a link to an image: Discord.js provides a Attachment class that allows you to send an attachment in a message.
- Code readability: The code can be made more readable by breaking it down into functions, using descriptive variable and function names, and adding comments.
- Use await for promises: You should use await for promises, where appropriate, to make the code cleaner and easier to understand.

## the structure of the database should change

- on every movie and birthday documents add a guildId key that specifies which guild the data was sent from. this will be used when wanting to pull data so the bot would only pull data related to the command calling guild.
- add a guildId to role and channel schemas so that the bot knows which channel and role belong to which guilds
- for the upcoming user activity recorder feature, make a db schema that sepcifies each guild members activity on vc and tc.
